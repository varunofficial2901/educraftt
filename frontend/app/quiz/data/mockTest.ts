const READING_PASSAGE_PART_1 = `EXTRACT 1: "The Space Between Stations" (Contemporary Fiction, 2023)
Amara pressed her forehead against the cold glass and watched the familiar terraces of Parramatta dissolve into streaks of amber light. Six months in Sydney, and she still felt like a tourist in her own suburb — as though the city had already written its story and simply forgotten to leave a page for her. Her mother said it would pass, the way jetlag passes: suddenly, without announcement. Amara was not convinced.

At school, she had learned to perform fluency. She laughed one beat after everyone else, timed it by watching their shoulders. She answered questions in class using the intonation she had practised in the bathroom mirror each morning — rising at the end, soft on the consonants, the way the television presenters spoke. Only her English teacher, Ms Osei, ever looked at her as though she were already complete, not a rough draft awaiting revision.

The train lurched, and the girl beside Amara — red-haired, freckled, wearing a hoodie that read "LOCAL" in block letters — glanced across. Amara braced for the question she always braced for: "Where are you actually from?" Instead, the girl held out an earbud. "Do you like Flume?" she asked. And Amara, for the first time in six months, said yes to something she actually meant.

EXTRACT 2: "The New Arrival" (Historical Fiction, set 1956, written 1987)
Konstantinos Papadimitriou stepped off the gangway at Station Pier and stood still while the crowd surged around him. He had expected a greeting — not a ceremony, but something. A sign, perhaps. He saw a man in a grey uniform holding a board that read MIGRATION and followed him without question, because that was what you did when you could not read the rest of the signs.

In the weeks that followed, he worked at a factory in Footscray where the machines were loud enough to make conversation unnecessary. He was grateful for this. When men spoke to him at lunchtime he smiled and nodded and ate his spanakopita quickly, folding the foil so that no one could see what was inside. By October he had learned twelve English words he considered essential: yes, no, sorry, excuse me, good morning, how much, and thank you.

The foreman — a large Scottish man named Barr who smelled of pipe tobacco — stopped beside his station one afternoon and said something long and complicated. Konstantinos understood only the final word: "good". He repeated it back — "good" — and Barr clapped him on the shoulder so hard his teeth knocked together. After that, Konstantinos decided that English, whatever else it was, was a language in which one word could carry the weight of many.`;

const READING_PASSAGE_PART_2 = `POEM — "Low Tide at Cronulla" by J. Hartley-Marsh
The water pulls its skirt back from the shore,
as though embarrassed by what lies beneath —
a litter of grey shells, the ocean's floor
exposed and unremarkable as grief.

The children do not notice. They are busy
with the living things — a crab that scuttles
sidewise from their shrieking, in a dizzy
arc of panic through the pooled-up puddles.

My grandmother once said the sea forgets
everything immediately. I think
she meant the tide — how nothing permanent sets
in salt, how even granite learns to sink.

I am standing at the border of two worlds:
the one that stays, the one that is erased.
The sea says nothing. Somewhere, a gull hurls
itself against the wind and is displaced.`;

const READING_PASSAGE_PART_3 = `ARTICLE — "Why Cities Are Getting Hotter" (adapted from Year 7 Science Magazine)
If you have ever walked barefoot across a suburban driveway on a summer afternoon, you have already encountered the urban heat island effect. Cities are measurably hotter than the rural land that surrounds them — sometimes by as much as 5°C — and scientists have been studying this phenomenon for nearly two centuries.

The cause is almost entirely architectural. Cities replace grass, trees and soil with concrete, asphalt and glass. Natural surfaces absorb sunlight during the day and release it slowly overnight, but also allow evaporation, which cools the ground. Hard surfaces such as concrete and bitumen, on the other hand, do neither. Without this natural cooling cycle, urban surfaces store heat like giant, slow-burning stoves.

Buildings compound the problem in a second way. Tall structures prevent wind from flowing freely through a city, reducing the natural ventilation that would otherwise carry excess heat away. This tunnel effect, sometimes called the "street canyon" phenomenon, is most severe in cities with very narrow streets and uniform building heights.

As urban temperatures rise, residents use more air conditioning, further increasing energy consumption. Air conditioning itself generates heat as a by-product, meaning that attempts to cool individual buildings can paradoxically warm the city as a whole.

Green roofs — rooftops covered with soil and living plants — can reduce a building's surface temperature by up to 40°C compared with conventional dark roofing materials. Rows of trees planted along streets provide shade and release water vapour, cooling the air. This approach has been trialled successfully in Singapore, Toronto and Stuttgart.

Researchers at the University of New South Wales found that painting just 10% of Sydney's roads and rooftops white could lower the city's average temperature by nearly 2°C. Lighter surfaces reflect more sunlight rather than absorbing it.

Addressing urban heat requires a systemic redesign of how cities are built and managed. Cities that have made the greatest progress — Amsterdam, Melbourne, and Medellín in Colombia — have embedded heat reduction into planning policy, architecture, public transport, and community design simultaneously.`;

const READING_PASSAGE_PART_4 = `TEXT A — Blog post: "AI Made Me a Better Cook" (personal lifestyle blog, April 2025)
I genuinely did not expect to become someone who asks a chatbot what to make for dinner. But here we are. I described the sad contents of my fridge — half a zucchini, some leftover rice, a suspiciously old block of halloumi — and within seconds had a coherent recipe. Was it perfect? No. Did I eat it? Absolutely. The thing nobody tells you about AI cooking assistants is that they have no ego. They do not judge you for your fridge. I find that oddly comforting.

TEXT B — School library report: "Understanding Artificial Intelligence" (NSW Dept of Education, 2024)
Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as recognising patterns, making decisions, and generating language. Modern AI tools use a process called machine learning, in which programs improve their performance over time by analysing large quantities of data. AI is now used across a broad range of sectors, including healthcare, transport, education, and entertainment. It is important to note that AI systems reflect the data they are trained on and may therefore reproduce existing biases present in that data.

TEXT C — Online book review: "The Algorithm Will See You Now" by Dr. Priya Shenfield (ReadersCircle, 2025)
Dr. Shenfield's central argument — that AI-driven diagnostic tools are already outperforming radiologists in detecting certain cancers — is both thrilling and deeply unnerving. She is not anti-technology; she is, if anything, a cautious enthusiast. But her chapters on accountability are sobering. When an AI misdiagnoses a patient, who is responsible? The programmer? The hospital? The algorithm itself? The book does not resolve this question, and nor, Shenfield argues, does current medical law.`;
